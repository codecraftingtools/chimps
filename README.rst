Chimps
======

Chimps is a concurrent hierarchic message-based programming
system. Chimps is a framework for building software by implementing
and connecting message-passing software components. It aims to provide
a standardized run-time environment for inter-component communication,
scheduling, timing, and logging functionality, as well as a set of
generalized application executives. Component messaging interfaces and
hierarchic structures are defined and generated using `Smidgen`_ and
`Finch`_, respectively.

`Chimps`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
